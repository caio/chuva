This is the example python code:

   https://developer.dataplatform.knmi.nl/open-data-api#example-last

With a few modifications so I can use it as a cronjob. Namely:

 - Takes dataset name/version from args

 - Reads the api key from systemd-creds if available. Falls back
   to env API_TOKEN for easier debugging

 - Doesn't download existing files

 - Deletes old files

 - Tries to kill -TERM a given service
