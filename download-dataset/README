This is the example python code:

Made to point at the radar-forecast dataset:

With a few modifications so I can use it as a cronjob. Namely:

 - Reads the api key from systemd-creds if available. Falls back
   to env API_TOKEN for easier debugging

 - Doesn't download existing files

 - Deletes old files
