Very dirty "script" that outputs the fst used by moros

It crawls the `pc6` directory from https://github.com/caio/netherlands-postcode-geojson
and generates what's essentially a `Map<String, u64>` that's used to access the
precipitation predictions

Naively one could fit the 465200 postcode-offset pairs with 10 bytes per entry (6 for
the postcode, 32bit offset), which leads to ~4.5M of data that one could efficiently
binary_search into.

With this trie it shrinks to ~1.8M, still gives really good exact-key search AND a
very easy/performant way to do prefix searches

The resulting postcodes.fst file is directly included in the binary via include_bytes!()
