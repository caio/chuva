I was horrified by the dependency tree of the crate I use to read
the dataset, so for added fun I decided to limit the rest as much
as possible. The most notable omission here is probably serde:
deciding not to have it in my dependency tree pushed me out of the
popular web frameworks, so I ended up with "just" hyper.

That's all it is, a thin hyper-based thing that the only thing it
does well is answering typical old-school web requests. Bytes in,
bytes out. It sucks at serving files or doing any other kind of
streaming.
